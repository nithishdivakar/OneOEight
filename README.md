An Experimentation with Splitting A Day into 108 Pieces.


This project is the result of a curiosity.  What if the clock displayed the time such that the day was split into 108 minutes rather than 1440 minutes.


This repository contain a generic clock framework(anyClock.js) which can display a clock according to division given as argument. If the argument is a list [24,60,60], it will display a normal, 24 hour, clock. Many other division are possible.

The anyClock.js is implemented on top of d3 framework so that it is fast in response.
